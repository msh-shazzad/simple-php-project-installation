# simple-php-project-installation
A simple way to install any php project to a new machine completed with registration and login

<b>Purpose</b><br/>
When we try to install a new project on a new machine it requires to edit the hostname, username, password and database name in
the database connection file(like dbcon.php/config.php). This project has been created to reduce the hassel of editing the database
connection file everytime the same project is installed on to different machine. Just insert the necessary informations once and
never look back.
